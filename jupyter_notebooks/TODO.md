TODO:

- Add daily warm up exercises and practice tasks
- Add machine learning / pandas stuff 
- Self-driving turtles??
- More fun student projects (the current ones are not that inspiring). Would be good to read over the students' interests and see if I can think up projects that would be good for them. 
- Make versions with and without the solutions
