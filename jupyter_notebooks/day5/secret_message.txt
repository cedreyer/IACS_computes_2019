TOP SECRET BROWNIES RECIPE

Yield: 25-30 brownies 

Ingredients

1 cup + 2 tbsp milk 
1/2 cup + 3 tbsp oil
1 tbsp pure vanilla extract
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup unsweetened cacao or cocoa powder
1/4 tsp + 1/8 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
2 tbsp cornstarch 

Instructions

Whisk together the first 3 ingredients, then set aside. Preheat oven to 330F. 
Grease a 9×13 pan (or 8×8 for thick brownies), or line with parchment paper, 
and set aside. In a large mixing bowl,thoroughly combine all dry ingredients. 
Stir wet into dry. Pour into the prepared pan. Smooth down. Bake 16 minutes, 
or 24 if using an 8×8. The brownies will look a little underdone when they 
come out, but that’s okay! Refrigerate – they start to firm up after a few 
hours and are nice and cut-able by the next day, and the taste is much better 
the next day as well. Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or freeze.
